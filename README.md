# Matrix Calculator

This is an program which lets you perform matrix calculation. My matrix calculator lets you define a matrix which it saves to a text file. You can then use these defined matrices in matrix operations which including addition, subtraction, multiplication and inversing 2x2 matrices. 

I created this using C.
